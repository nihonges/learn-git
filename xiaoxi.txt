Subject: Questions Regarding “Divide” Function and Training Workflow

Dear [Name/Team],

I hope you are doing well. I have a few questions regarding the image dividing and training workflow in the software:

Divide Interface – Overlap Setting
In the “Divide” interface, I could not find the option for “Add Overlap”. Could you please advise where this option is located, or whether it has been moved or removed in the current version?

Large Number of Sub-Images
After dividing one image into small patches, for example 8 original images may result in ~800 sub-images. When using the Training Helper, it seems I cannot directly assign them into the training set in batch. Do I need to manually add them one-by-one, or is there a recommended method to import and label them more efficiently?

Set as OK / Set View Tag / Set Image Tag
I would also like to confirm the meaning and impact of:

Set as OK

Set View Tag

Set Image Tag

How do these settings influence the training process? Which ones are necessary for training, and in what cases should they be used?

Log Files Location
Lastly, where can I find the log file you mentioned earlier? I found several files with “log” in the name, but none of them seem to contain the time-related information since the software has already been closed. Please let me know the exact path or filename I should look for.

Thank you very much for your support. I appreciate your guidance.

Best regards,
