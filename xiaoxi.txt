My original images were already annotated (as shown in the screenshot). After dividing the images, I can still see all the annotations listed in Annotation Management, so the annotation data is definitely still there.

However, when I switch the view from Show All to Annotated, no images appear. Also, when I try to right-click and batch add them to the Training Set, I get an error.

It seems that the software is not recognizing the divided images as “annotated.”
Could you please advise what might be causing this? Do I need to manually re-link the annotations or refresh the dataset index?

Thanks!
