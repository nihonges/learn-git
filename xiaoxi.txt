You can use the Image Filter → Annotated option to display only the annotated images.
 
If your original images were already annotated, and you later changed the View (for example, after dividing the image), the annotations will be automatically retained in the new dataset.
You can then select all images and right-click to open the context menu, then choose Batch Save to assign them to the training set efficiently — no need to add them one by one.
